Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data

The data came from a study of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.  
30 volunteers were studied from 19 to 48 years of age and each of them performed activities
with Samsung Galaxy S II's on their waist.

The following is information about the data used:
Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate, Time-Series
Attribute Characteristics: N/A
Associated Tasks: Classification, Clustering
Number of Instances: 10299
Number of Attributes: 561
Missing Values: None
Area: Computer

The following variables were used as activity labels:
WALKING 
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
SITTING           
STANDING
LAYING


The following variables were used as column labels in order to determine what happened to each individual during each excersize:
